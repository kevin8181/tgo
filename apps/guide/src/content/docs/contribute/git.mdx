The files for this project are managed with [Git](https://git-scm.com/), which is a tool for tracking changes and versions of code. Our Git project (or "repository") is hosted by a website called [Github](https://github.com).

## Setting up your Local Environment

To make edits to this project and contribute them, you will need to make a local copy of the project on your own computer.

<Steps>

1.  #### Install Git

    [Make sure you have Git installed](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-using-github-desktop). If you're on Linux or Mac, it may be pre-installed for you.

    If not, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

    ###

2.  #### Clone the Project

    Run this command to create a local copy, or "clone", of the project on your computer:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tgoHQ/knowledgebase
    ```

3.  #### Install Node

    This project requires the Node.js runtime in order to run. See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#install--update-script).

4.  ### Install pnpm

    ```bash
    npm i -g pnpm
    ```

5.  #### Set up your Editor

    If you don't already have a preferred code editor, we suggest [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This project contains files that will automatically configure some VSCode settings for you and suggest the appropriate plugins needed to give you syntax highlighting and autocompletion.

6.  #### Start it Up!

    Now you're ready to launch the site and start making edits.

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This will launch the local development server. Go to [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) to see a live copy of the site. It will automatically update as you make changes.
