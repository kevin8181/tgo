## Article Structure

Articles are written using MDX. Each article is its own `.mdx` file, which contains a metadata section and a content section:

```mdx title="src/content/docs/example.mdx"
---
title: Example Article
description: A demonstration of how articles are structured
---

This is the content of the example article!
```

[Metadata](/contribute/content/frontmatter) about the article lives at the top of the file, between two sets of `---` tags. The [content](/contribute/content/markup) of the article goes below the second `---` tag.

## Creating a New Article

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1.  #### Article concept

    First you'll need a concept for your article. See our [list of planned articles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TRKIPZgA0pLXjN-34byP6n940qy4x5YIRYE2ZLvFzHM/edit) for ideas.

2.  #### Create the file

    Create a new `.mdx` file in the appropriate folder within `src/content/docs`. The name of the file is the default URL for the page. Files named `index.mdx` will be served on path of the parent folder.

3.  #### Write your metadata

    Check out the [Article Metadata](/contribute/content/frontmatter) guide.

4.  #### Write your content

    See our [Stylistic Standards](/contribute/content/style) [Markup Reference](/contribute/content/markup) for more info.

5.  #### Create a pull request

        If you're new to Git, refer to our [Working with Git](/contribute/git/) guide.
