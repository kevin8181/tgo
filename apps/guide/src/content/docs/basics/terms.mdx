# Day-hiking

A "day hike" refers to a short hiking trip where you do not spend the night on trail.

# Backpacking

Backpacking is a hiking trip spread over multiple days. You carry your camping gear with you and sleep along the trail.

# Car Camping

Many non-backpacking camping trips are considered "car camping", which is when you camp within a short walk of your vehicle. This allows you to bring more and heavier gear.

# Thru-hiking

A thru-hike is when a hiker completes a long trail, typically 100-2000+ miles, in one continuous backpacking trip.
