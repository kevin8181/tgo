Creating a gear list is an important step in planning for a trip.
A good gear list allows you to organize your thoughts, understand your pack weight, and get feedback from others.

:::tip[Get a scale!]
It is strongly recommended you use a kitchen scale to weigh your gear. Having an accurate weight for each piece of gear will make the gear list musch more useful to you. Manufacturer-listed weights can often be innacurate!

## Lighterpack

The best tool for creating your backpacking gear list is [Lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com). You can arrange your items into categories and specify a weight and price.
You can also mark worn and consumable items. It creates a chart and table to summarize the weight of your setup. You also get a shareable link that you can use for collaboration or getting feedback.

A lighterpack list is embedded below for example:

import Lighterpack from '@components/content/Lighterpack.astro';

<Lighterpack slug="sl6c8y" />
