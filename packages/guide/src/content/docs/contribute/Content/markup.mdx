## Content

The article content is written in MDX, which is an extension of Markdown. It's similar to the formatting you may be familiar with from Discord or Github.

```mdx
## This is heading level 2

### Heading level 3

**Here's some bold text**

_italic_

~~strikethrough~~

this is some `inline code`

-   a bulleted list
    -   with sub-bullets
```

:::tip
There are lots of other features available for you to use, such as numbered lists, masked links, embedded images, asides (like this "tip" callout), tables, block quotes, and more.

### YouTube

Use the `YouTube` component to embed a YouTube video:

```mdx
import { YouTube } from '@astro-community/astro-embed-youtube';

<YouTube id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb3UrJjAac4" />
```

import { YouTube } from '@astro-community/astro-embed-youtube';

<YouTube id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb3UrJjAac4" />

### Lighterpack Lists

Use the `Lighterpack` component to embed a [Lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com) gear list. In this example, we're embedding the list `https://lighterpack.com/r/sl6c8y`. The last part of this url, called the "slug", gets passed to the `Lighterpack` component:

```js
import Lighterpack from '@components/content/Lighterpack.astro';

<Lighterpack slug="sl6c8y" />;
```

import Lighterpack from '@components/content/Lighterpack.astro';

<Lighterpack slug="sl6c8y" />
