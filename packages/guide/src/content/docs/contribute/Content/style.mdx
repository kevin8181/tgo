## Writing Style

-   Articles should read like an encyclopedia or nonfiction book.
-   Don't include "I" or write in a narrative format.
-   Be explanatory and to-the-point. Avoid long introductions/conclusions.
-   Articles should mainly be about concepts and skills. Avoid talking about specific locations, products, or people when possible.

## Sidebar Labels

-   Sidebar labels should be kept as short as possible while still communicating the purpose of the page. They should usually be shorter than the title of the article.

## Headings

-   The heading heirarchy starts at the `h2` (##) level. The page title is an `h1` (#).
-   Keep headings short. `h2` (##) and `h3` (###) headings will appear in the article outline. Preview the table of contents and rephrase to shorten headings if the sidebar entry looks too long.
-   Headings shouldn't have punctuation.
-   Headings should be written in [title case](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case).
