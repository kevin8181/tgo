title: Layering System
---

An effective outdoor clothing kit is built from *layers*.
Each layer in your system will fufill a particular responsibility.
This allows you to create many different combinations of layers to suit the conditions.

## Base Layers

Base layers are tight-fitting, moisture-wicking garments worn next to the skin. Its purpose is to pull moisture away from your skin.
These layers are typically made of synthetics (polypropelene, polyester) or wool. In hot weather, your base layer might be your only layer.


## Midlayers

The purpose of a midlayer is to trap heat by insulating your body.

### Static Insulation

Static insulation provides warmth for static activities like sitting in camp. Static insulation layers are most commonly "puffy" jackets, filled with synthetic or down insulation. These layers provide lots of heat in a lightweight package, but lack the breathability needed for use duing activities like hiking.

### Active Insulation

Active insulation layers, or "active layers", are fleece-like garments that provide warmth while maintaining high breathability.

## Shell Layers

Shell layers are the outermost layers which protect you from moisture and wind. They feature a hard face that water beads off of. Rain jackets/pants that contain a waterproof membrane are often called "hardshells".
