As outdoors enthusiasts, we bear an important responsibility to preserve the natural areas we hike and camp in. Overuse and misuse of our forests and fields can lead to trashed campsites, wildfires, overcrowding, and damage to plant and animal populations.

[Leave No Trace](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/), the Center for Outdoor Ethics, has created 7 simple principles we can follow to minimize our impacts and preserve nature for generations to come.

## The 7 Principles

<Steps>

1. #### Plan Ahead & Prepare

    When outdoor visitors plan ahead and prepare, it helps to accomplish trip goals safely and enjoyably while simultaneously minimizing damage to the land. Poor planning often results in a less enjoyable experience and damage to natural and cultural resources.

    - Know the regulations and special concerns for the area you'll visit.
    - Prepare for extreme weather, hazards, and emergencies.
    - Schedule your trip to avoid times of high use.
    - Visit in small groups. Split larger parties into smaller groups.

2. #### Travel & Camp on Durable Surfaces

    The goal of travel outdoors is to move through natural areas while avoiding damage to the land, foliage, or waterways. Travel damage occurs when surface vegetation or communities of organisms are trampled beyond recovery.

    - Durable surfaces include established trails, campsites, rock, gravel, and dry grasses or snow.
    - Protect riparian areas by camping at least 200 feet from lakes and streams.
    - Good campsites are found, not made. Altering a site is not necessary.

3. #### Dispose of Waste Properly

    The waste humans create while enjoying outdoor spaces can have severe impacts if not disposed of properly. It is crucial to anticipate the types of waste you will need to dispose of and know the proper techniques for disposing of each type of waste in the area you are visiting.

    - Pack it in, pack it out. Inspect your campsite and rest areas for trash or spilled food. Pack out all trash, leftover food, and litter. Burning trash is never recommended.
    - Deposit solid human waste and toilet paper in catholes dug 6-8 inches deep at least 200 feet from water, camp, and trails. Cover and disguise the cathole when finished.
    - To wash yourself or your dishes, carry water 200 feet away from streams or lakes and use small amounts of biodegradable soap. Scatter strained dishwater.

4. #### Leave What You Find

    The items we find in nature have a role to play, either in the ecosystem or the story of the landscape. Leaving what we find in place helps to preserve both.

    - Preserve the past: observe cultural or historic structures and artifacts, but do not touch them.
    - Leave rocks, plants, and other natural objects as you find them.
    - Avoid introducing or transporting non-native species.
    - Do not build structures, furniture, or dig trenches.

5. #### Minimize Campfire Impacts

    Once necessary for cooking and warmth, campfires are steeped in history and tradition. Some people would not think of camping without a campfire. Yet, the natural appearance of many areas has been degraded by the overuse of fires and increasing demand for firewood. Moreover, wildfires continue to threaten outdoor spaces and are primarily caused by humans.

    - Campfires can cause lasting impacts on the environment. Use a lightweight stove for cooking and a lantern for light.
    - Use established fire rings, pans, or mound fires where fires are permitted.
    - Keep fires small. Use only sticks from the ground that can be broken by hand.
    - Burn all wood and coals to ash, put out campfires completely, then scatter cool ashes.

6. #### Respect Wildlife

    Whenever you are in an outdoor space, you are in the natural habitat of many wild animals and should work to minimize your impact on them. Human impacts on wildlife can result in negative human-wildlife interactions, aggressive animals, a decline in the ecosystem's health, and relocated or euthanized animals.

    - Observe wildlife from a distance. Do not follow or approach them.
    - Never feed animals. Feeding wildlife damages their health, alters natural behaviors, and exposes them to predators and other dangers.
    - Control pets at all times, or leave them at home.

7. #### Be Considerate of Others

    Excessive noise, uncontrolled pets, and damaged surroundings detract from the natural appeal of the outdoors. Being considerate of others ensures everyone can enjoy nature no matter how they interact with it.

    - Be courteous. Yield to other users on the trail.
    - Take breaks and camp away from trails and others.
    - Let nature's sounds prevail. Avoid loud voices and noises.
