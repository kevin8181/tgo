The prices of outdoor gear can be overwhelming. This page contains some tips to help you find gear for lower prices.

## Price Comparison Websites

[Google Shopping](https://shopping.google.com) can be used for price comparison in most countries. The downside is that this only shows local prices.

In Europe there is a website called [idealo](https://idealo.de) that shows prices across Europe. In addition, it allows you to set price notifications and see the price history of the past year.

## Buying Used

If you want even better deals, look for used or refurbished options. You can use local marketplace websites, Ebay, Facebook marketplace, or [REI re/supply](https://www.rei.com/used). On Reddit, [r/geartrade](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearTrade/) and [r/ulgeartrade](https://www.reddit.com/r/ULgeartrade/) are good places to check.
Make sure to take the necessary [precautions](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/how-to-sell-and-buy-secondhand-things-online-without-getting-scammed/) to prevent yourself from being scammed.

## Outlets

Some outdoors retailers offer outlets where products are sold at a reduced price. One example of this is [REI Outlet](https://www.rei.com/outlet).
